/**
 * Shared "this build HAS a tray, and it is running" primitive for the LunarWerx daemons.
 *
 * ⛔ WHY EVERY KIT APP NEEDS THIS (owner, 2026-09-11, on finding a freshly compiled AgentHydra with
 * no icon): "if we're not including a tray in that compiled executable, that's a [bug] - it needs to
 * be fixed in this and probably a couple of the others." He was right on both counts. Every kit app
 * ships `misc\lunarwerx-tray.exe` (340 KB, src/tray-host-native) and every kit app also builds a
 * SINGLE-FILE exe with `bun build --compile` that embeds the web assets and nothing else. So the
 * download most people take could never show an icon, never offer Quit, and never get the
 * auto-restart supervisor - and each app's README had simply written that down as a limitation.
 * 340 KB is not a reason to ship an app with no visible handle.
 *
 * This module is the whole mechanism, in one place, because it had already been re-derived once and
 * would have been re-derived three more times:
 *
 *   1. MATERIALIZE - write the embedded host, its config and its icon out of the compiled binary
 *      into `<stateDir>/tray/<version>`, rewriting the config's shipped `appRoot: ".."` (correct
 *      only for the extracted zip) to the absolute directory of the RUNNING exe, and `compiledExe`
 *      to that exe's real filename, so a renamed or relocated download still gets a watchdog.
 *      Version-scoped: Windows cannot overwrite a running image, and the EACCES it raises reads as
 *      a permissions problem that isn't one.
 *   2. PROBE - answer "is a host running?" as a TRI-STATE. ⛔ The first version of this asked
 *      `Get-Process -Name lunarwerx-tray -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select -ExpandProperty Id`
 *      and read a non-zero exit as "running". SilentlyContinue suppresses the error TEXT, not the
 *      error RECORD: with no such process powershell.exe exits 1. Measured 2026-09-11: absent ->
 *      exit 1, present -> exit 0. The one case the probe exists for was the one it got backwards,
 *      so the daemon's own "start the tray if nothing else did" could never once have fired.
 *   3. START - launch the host when nothing else has. An UNKNOWN from the probe means START: the
 *      host claims a named mutex, so a double start cannot produce two icons (the loser opens the
 *      UI and exits), while NOT starting leaves the app with no icon at all. A caller that can
 *      SHUT THE DAEMON DOWN on the same signal (AgentHydra's tray invariant) must resolve the
 *      unknown the other way, which is exactly why this returns the unknown instead of choosing.
 *
 * Everything app-specific - the config filename, the icon filename, where the embedded files came
 * from - is a parameter. The host binary's name is not: it is the kit's own artifact.

 * named mutex for the same reason. Without a configFile this counts any host, which is the old
